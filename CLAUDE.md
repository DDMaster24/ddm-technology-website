# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static single-page website for DDM-Technology, serving as the official web presence for Google Play Console organization verification. It's a temporary simple site deployed on GitHub Pages, with plans for a full professional website after app deployment.

## Architecture

**Single-page static site**: The entire website is contained in `index.html` with embedded CSS styling. No build process, dependencies, or external frameworks are used.

**Design approach**: Modern gradient design (purple/blue theme) with responsive CSS grid layout for services section. Uses system fonts and CSS gradients for visual effects.

**Content sections**:
- Company branding and tagline
- About Us section
- Services grid (Mobile Apps, Web Development, Cloud Solutions, Custom Software)
- Featured project showcase (Little Latte Lane restaurant platform)
- Contact information
- Footer

## Deployment

**GitHub Pages**: The site is deployed directly from the repository to GitHub Pages at the main branch.

**Remote**: `https://github.com/DDMaster24/ddm-technology-website.git`

**No build required**: Simply edit `index.html` and push to deploy changes.

## Making Changes

When editing the site:
- All content and styling is in `index.html`
- Maintain the gradient color scheme: `#667eea` and `#764ba2`
- Preserve responsive design breakpoint at 600px
- Keep the professional, modern aesthetic
- Test responsiveness when adding new sections
